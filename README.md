## ELEC40004 Programming For Engineers 2021-2022 Work

Here is my work for the Imperial EEE First year module Programming for Engineers taught by Dr. Max Cattafi

```C++
    #include <iostream>

    int main(){
        std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
        return 0;
    }

```

This module covered a vast amount of topics including

-Programming environments
-Basic I/O
-Variables
-Expressions
-Conditionals
-Loops
-Functions
-Vectors
-Text Files
-The Standard Template Library
-Structured data types
-Classes
-Abstraction and encapsulation
-Arrays, pointers, dynamic memory
-Implementing data structures (vectors, lists, trees)
-Algorithms and recursion
-Introduction to inheritance and polymorphism
